Quick guide for developers on getting RInside built
and installed to integrate with GoldenCheetah

Make sure you have a working GC build already.

1. install R

2. install Rcpp

R> install.packages("Rcpp")
R> q()

3. install RInside with callback enabled

$ cd ~
$ mkdir temp
$ cd temp
$ git clone https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rinside.git RInside
$ vi RInside/inst/include/RInsideConfig.h

we use vi, but use an editor of your choice
uncomment the line from:
// #define RINSIDE_CALLBACKS

to look like this:
#define RINSIDE_CALLBACKS

$ R CMD INSTALL RInside

The package is now installed and available to embed
within GC, so we can now just delete the temp directory
and contents we just created:

4. cd ..
5. rm -rf temp

Now we can build GC with R enabled:

6. cd <GoldenCheetah src directory>
7. vi gcconfig.pri

we use vi, but use an editor of your choice
add the line:

DEFINES += GC_WANT_R

8. qmake
9. make

All should be good. If its working help>about>version
should show the version of R that is embedded.
